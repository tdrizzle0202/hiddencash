We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.

### 7.4 Third-Party Services

The App relies on third-party services and links to state government websites. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or practices of these third parties.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

**TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:**
